
### ABOUT ME
After undergrad I started my career as an IT professional at Infosys Ltd, Mysore, India.

My job profile as a systems engineer at Infosys was to develop an enterprise application using various technologies.

At Infosys I realized my potential to quickly understand technical, managerial aspects of IT and the relation between them. 

It is this realized potential and my passion towards leading in Techno-Managerial roles that led me to pursue my Masters in [Information Technology and Management](http://jindal.utdallas.edu/isom/information-systems-programs/ms-information-technology/) at The University of Texas at Dallas. 

Concentrating in Business Intelligence and Analytics I have learned a wide range of technical and managerial subjects at UT Dallas
